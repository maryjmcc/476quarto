The Wind River Experimental Forest (WREF) is a field site about 40 miles NE of Vancouver, WA in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The area is classified as an evergreen forest, populated by douglas firs and western hemlocks of diverse ages. The region's climate is temperate with an average temperature of 9.2°C and average precipitation of 87.6 in. In the valley of volcanoes, Mt. Rainier and Mt. St. Helens, the soil here is comprised of volcanic ash, pumice, basalt bedrock, and andesite (leftover from lava flows). Among the animals living in this area are elk, bobcats, cougars, black bears, various birds, and many small mammals.

After being used as a seedling nursery for post-wildfire forest rehabilitation for almost a century, the NEON site was established in 2006 and sampling for the project began in 2018.

WREF has a lower average pH value than the other NEON sites. This may explain why WREF has one of the highest counts of acidobacteriota of the NEON sites, and also why acidobacteriota is the most common phylum at WREF.

As seen in the above phylogenetic trees, there is only one phylum, methylomirabilota, that is not present in the pH less than 4.
