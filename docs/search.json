    "text": "Acidobacteriota are a diverse phylum of bacteria that can be found in many different habitats, such as soil, oceans, caves, and hot springs. Most members of this phylum are acidophilic. Despite how common they are, not much is known about acidobacteria, as they are difficult to grow in culture.\nAcidobacteria are believed to play several ecological roles, such as plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria, decomposers, especially of complex carbohydrates, as well as sulfur metabolism. They are also considered keystone taxa, which are taxa that are important for the stability of the ecosystem in grasslands, forests, and agricultural soils.\n\n\n\nAcidobacteriota on the NEON phylogenetic tree\n\n\n\n\n\nCounts of Acidobacteriota at the NEON sites\n\n\n\n\n\nAcidobacteriota at each site by class\n\n\n\n\n\nAcidobacteriota at each site by order\n\n\n\n\n\nSankey plot of Acidobacteriota phylogeny"

    "text": "The Wind River Experimental Forest (WREF) is a field site about 40 miles NE of Vancouver, WA in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The area is classified as an evergreen forest, populated by douglas firs and western hemlocks of diverse ages. The region’s climate is temperate with an average temperature of 9.2°C and average precipitation of 87.6 in. In the valley of volcanoes, Mt. Rainier and Mt. St. Helens, the soil here is comprised of volcanic ash, pumice, basalt bedrock, and andesite (leftover from lava flows). Among the animals living in this area are elk, bobcats, cougars, black bears, various birds, and many small mammals.\nAfter being used as a seedling nursery for post-wildfire forest rehabilitation for almost a century, the NEON site was established in 2006 and sampling for the project began in 2018. \n\n\n\nCount of phylums present at WREF\n\n\n\n\n\nSankey plot of the phylogeny of bacteria present at WREF\n\n\n\n\n\nPhylogenetic tree for bacteria present at WREF\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil pH of the NEON sites\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil temperature and pH at NEON sites\n\n\nWREF has a lower average pH value than the other NEON sites.
